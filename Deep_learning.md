## Neural Network Fundamentals

### Activation Functions: A Deeper Dive
- **ReLU**: f(x) = max(0, x)
  - Pros: No vanishing gradient for positive values, computationally efficient
  - Cons: "Dying ReLU" problem for negative inputs
- **Leaky ReLU**: f(x) = max(αx, x), where α is a small constant (e.g., 0.01)
  - Addresses the dying ReLU problem
- **Parametric ReLU (PReLU)**: Learns the α parameter during training
- **Exponential Linear Unit (ELU)**: f(x) = x if x > 0, else α(e^x - 1)
  - Smooth function, can produce negative outputs
- **Scaled Exponential Linear Unit (SELU)**: Self-normalizing properties
  - Particularly useful for deep networks
- **Swish**: f(x) = x * sigmoid(x)
  - Smooth, non-monotonic function

Tip: Experiment with different activation functions. While ReLU is a good default, others might perform better for specific tasks.

### Loss Functions: Advanced Considerations

### Optimizers: Beyond the Basics
- **Adam**: Adaptive Moment Estimation
  - Combines ideas from RMSprop and momentum
  - Default choice for many practitioners

### Batch Normalization Alternatives
- **Layer Normalization**: Normalizes across features, useful for RNNs and Transformers
- **Instance Normalization**: Useful for style transfer tasks
- **Group Normalization**: Compromise between Layer and Instance Normalization
