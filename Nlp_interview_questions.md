## Basic Concepts

1. **Q: What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?**
   A: Natural Language Processing is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. It involves the ability of computers to understand, interpret, generate, and manipulate human language.

2. **Q: What are some common applications of NLP?**
   A: Common applications include:
   - Machine translation
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Chatbots and virtual assistants
   - Text summarization
   - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
   - Question answering systems
   - Speech recognition

3. **Q: What are the main challenges in NLP?**
   A: Some main challenges include:
   - Ambiguity in language (words with multiple meanings)
   - Context dependency
   - Handling idioms and sarcasm
   - Dealing with multiple languages
   - Processing informal or noisy text (e.g., social media posts)
   - Keeping up with evolving language and new terms

4. **Q: What is the difference between NLP and NLU?**
   A: NLP (Natural Language Processing) is a broader field that encompasses all aspects of computer-human language interaction. NLU (Natural Language Understanding) is a subset of NLP that focuses specifically on machine reading comprehension, i.e., the ability of computers to understand and interpret human language.

5. **Q: What is tokenization and why is it important in NLP?**
   A: Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens, typically words or subwords. It's important because it's often the first step in many NLP tasks, allowing the text to be processed and analyzed at a granular level.

## Text Preprocessing

6. **Q: What is stemming and how does it differ from lemmatization?**
   A: Stemming and lemmatization are both text normalization techniques:
   - Stemming reduces words to their stem/root form, often by simple rules like removing endings. It's faster but can sometimes produce non-words.
   - Lemmatization reduces words to their base or dictionary form (lemma). It's more accurate but slower and requires knowledge of the word's part of speech.

7. **Q: What are stop words and why might you remove them?**
   A: Stop words are common words in a language that are often filtered out during text processing (e.g., "the", "is", "at"). They're often removed because they typically don't carry much meaning and removing them can reduce noise in the data. However, in some tasks (like sentiment analysis), stop words might be important and should be retained.

8. **Q: What is the purpose of lowercasing text in NLP?**
   A: Lowercasing text helps to standardize the input, reducing the vocabulary size and treating words like "The" and "the" as the same token. This can be helpful in many NLP tasks. However, it's not always appropriate, such as in Named Entity Recognition where capitalization can be an important feature.

9. **Q: How would you handle contractions in text preprocessing?**
   A: Handling contractions typically involves expanding them to their full form (e.g., "don't" to "do not"). This can be done using a dictionary of common contractions or more advanced techniques for less common ones. It's important because it standardizes the text and can help in tasks like sentiment analysis.

## Feature Extraction

10. **Q: What is the Bag of Words (BoW) model?**
    A: The Bag of Words model is a simple representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It creates a vocabulary of all unique words in the corpus and represents each document as a vector of word counts or frequencies, disregarding grammar and word order.

11. **Q: Explain TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).**
    A: TF-IDF is a numerical statistic that reflects the importance of a word in a document within a collection or corpus. It's calculated as:
    - TF (Term Frequency): How often a word appears in a document
    - IDF (Inverse Document Frequency): The inverse of the fraction of documents that contain the word
    TF-IDF is high for words that appear frequently in a few documents and low for words that appear in many documents.

12. **Q: What are word embeddings?**
    A: Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words in a lower-dimensional continuous vector space. They capture semantic meanings and relationships between words. Popular word embedding techniques include Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText.

13. **Q: How does Word2Vec work?**
    A: Word2Vec is a technique for learning word embeddings. It uses a shallow neural network to learn vector representations of words based on their context in a large corpus. There are two main architectures:
    - Skip-gram: Predicts context words given a target word
    - Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW): Predicts a target word given its context

## Classical NLP Techniques

14. **Q: What is the Naive Bayes classifier and how is it used in NLP?**
    A: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with an assumption of independence between features. In NLP, it's often used for text classification tasks like spam detection or sentiment analysis. It works well with high-dimensional data like text and is particularly effective with small training datasets.

15. **Q: Explain the concept of N-grams in NLP.**
    A: N-grams are contiguous sequences of n items (words, characters, etc.) from a given text. For example:
    - Unigrams (1-grams): single words
    - Bigrams (2-grams): pairs of consecutive words
    - Trigrams (3-grams): triples of consecutive words
    N-grams are used to capture local context and are useful in various NLP tasks like language modeling and text generation.

16. **Q: What is Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging?**
    A: Part-of-Speech tagging is the process of marking up words in a text with their corresponding part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective). It's a fundamental step in many NLP pipelines and is useful for tasks like named entity recognition and syntactic parsing.

17. **Q: What is Named Entity Recognition (NER)?**
    A: Named Entity Recognition is the task of identifying and classifying named entities (like person names, organizations, locations) in text into predefined categories. It's a crucial component in many NLP applications, including information extraction and question answering systems.

## Machine Learning for NLP

18. **Q: How can Support Vector Machines (SVMs) be used in NLP?**
    A: SVMs can be used for various NLP tasks, particularly text classification. They work well with high-dimensional data like TF-IDF vectors. SVMs aim to find the hyperplane that best separates different classes, making them effective for tasks like sentiment analysis or topic classification.

19. **Q: What is the role of decision trees and random forests in NLP?**
    A: Decision trees and random forests can be used for text classification tasks in NLP. They work well with high-dimensional, sparse data like text. Random forests, being an ensemble method, often perform better than individual decision trees and can provide feature importance scores, which can be useful for understanding which words or features are most predictive.

20. **Q: How can clustering algorithms be applied to NLP problems?**
    A: Clustering algorithms like K-means can be used in NLP for tasks such as:
    - Document clustering: Grouping similar documents together
    - Topic modeling: Discovering abstract topics in a collection of documents
    - Word sense disambiguation: Grouping different occurrences of a word based on its meaning in context

## Deep Learning for NLP

21. **Q: How are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) used in NLP?**
    A: RNNs are used in NLP for tasks involving sequential data, such as:
    - Language modeling
    - Machine translation
    - Speech recognition
    - Text generation
    They can process input of any length and maintain information about previous inputs, making them suitable for many NLP tasks.

22. **Q: What are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and why are they useful in NLP?**
    A: LSTMs are a type of RNN designed to handle the vanishing gradient problem, allowing them to learn long-term dependencies. They're particularly useful in NLP for tasks that require understanding of long-range context, such as machine translation, sentiment analysis on longer texts, and document classification.

23. **Q: Explain the concept of attention mechanism in NLP.**
    A: The attention mechanism allows a model to focus on different parts of the input when producing each part of the output. In NLP, this means the model can attend to different words or phrases when generating each word of the output. This has been particularly successful in machine translation and has led to the development of transformer models.

24. **Q: What is a transformer model and why has it become popular in NLP?**
    A: Transformer is a deep learning model that uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data. It has become popular in NLP because:
    - It can handle long-range dependencies better than RNNs
    - It allows for more parallelization, making training faster
    - It has achieved state-of-the-art results on many NLP tasks
    Models like BERT and GPT are based on the transformer architecture.

## NLP Tasks

25. **Q: What is sentiment analysis?**
    A: Sentiment analysis is the task of determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text. It typically involves classifying the text as positive, negative, or neutral, but can also include more fine-grained emotions. It's commonly used for analyzing customer feedback, social media monitoring, and market research.

26. **Q: How does machine translation work?**
    A: Modern machine translation typically uses neural machine translation (NMT) models. These are usually sequence-to-sequence models that encode the source language sentence into a vector representation and then decode it into the target language. Attention mechanisms and transformer models have significantly improved the quality of machine translation.

27. **Q: What is text summarization?**
    A: Text summarization is the task of creating a short, accurate, and fluent summary of a longer text document. There are two main approaches:
    - Extractive summarization: Selects and orders existing sentences from the text
    - Abstractive summarization: Generates new sentences that capture the essential information

28. **Q: What is the difference between closed-domain and open-domain question answering?**
    A: Closed-domain question answering systems answer questions under a specific domain (e.g., medical, legal), while open-domain systems aim to answer questions about virtually anything. Open-domain systems are generally more challenging as they require broader knowledge and the ability to handle a wider variety of question types.

## Evaluation Metrics

29. **Q: What is perplexity and how is it used in language modeling?**
    A: Perplexity is a measure of how well a probability model predicts a sample. In language modeling, lower perplexity indicates better performance. It's calculated as the exponential of the cross-entropy loss. Perplexity can be interpreted as the weighted average number of choices the model has when predicting the next word.

30. **Q: What is BLEU score and when is it used?**
    A: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is an algorithm for evaluating the quality of machine-translated text. It compares a candidate translation to one or more reference translations and computes a similarity score based on n-gram precision. BLEU is commonly used in machine translation but has limitations, especially for languages with different word orders than the reference.

31. **Q: How is F1 score used in NLP tasks?**
    A: F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It's commonly used in NLP for evaluating classification tasks, especially when there's an uneven class distribution. For multi-class problems, you can compute F1 for each class and then average (macro-F1) or compute over all classes together (micro-F1).

## Practical Scenarios

32. **Q: How would you approach building a spam detection system?**
    A: Steps might include:
    1. Data collection and labeling
    2. Text preprocessing (lowercasing, removing punctuation, tokenization)
    3. Feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings)
    4. Model selection (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, or neural networks)
    5. Model training and evaluation
    6. Deployment and continuous monitoring/updating

33. **Q: In a chatbot project, how would you handle out-of-scope queries?**
    A: Strategies could include:
    - Training a classifier to recognize out-of-scope queries
    - Using confidence scores from the intent classification model
    - Implementing fallback responses
    - Providing options for human handover
    - Continuously updating the model with new, correctly labeled out-of-scope queries

34. **Q: How would you approach a multi-language NLP project?**
    A: Approaches could include:
    - Using multilingual models like mBERT or XLM-R
    - Training separate models for each language
    - Using translation as an intermediate step
    - Leveraging transfer learning from high-resource to low-resource languages
    - Considering language-specific preprocessing steps

## Tools and Libraries

35. **Q: What are some popular Python libraries for NLP?**
    A: Popular NLP libraries in Python include:
    - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
    - spaCy
    - Gensim
    - Transformers (by Hugging Face)
    - Stanford CoreNLP
    - TextBlob

36. **Q: What is the purpose of the Hugging Face Transformers library?**
    A: The Hugging Face Transformers library provides pre-trained models for various NLP tasks. It offers an easy-to-use API for using and fine-tuning state-of-the-art models like BERT, GPT, and T5. It's particularly useful for transfer learning in NLP tasks.

37. **Q: How would you use spaCy for named entity recognition?**
    A: SpaCy provides pre-trained models for NER. Here's a basic example:

    ```python
    import spacy

    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
    text = "Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion"
    doc = nlp(text)

    for ent in doc.ents:
        print(ent.text, ent.label_)
    ```

    This would identify entities like "Apple" (ORG), "U.K." (GPE), and "$1 billion" (MONEY).
